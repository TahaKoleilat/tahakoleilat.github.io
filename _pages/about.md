![Illustration of medical segmentation](/images/images.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student at Concordia University working with [IMPACT Lab](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~impact/) and [Health-X Lab](http://www.healthx-lab.ca/) under the supervision of [Hassan Rivaz](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~hrivaz/) and [Yiming Xiao](https://yimingxiao.weebly.com/curriculum-vitae.html).

🔬 My research interests are in multi-modal learning, foundation models, and medical image analysis!

📚 I'm currently working on exciting projects leveraging CLIP and SAM for universal medical image segmentation.

<!-- 📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia. -->

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Ongoing Research
I am currently engaged in exciting research at the intersection of text and vision, with a specific focus on medical imaging. By seamlessly integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision methodologies, my work aims to revolutionize how textual descriptions and visual data from multiple medical imaging modalities are analyzed and interpreted. This interdisciplinary approach holds tremendous potential to advance diagnostic precision, optimize clinical processes, and ultimately elevate patient care standards within the realm of medical imaging. 

<!-- ## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Relevant Experience
I have also a strong background in Cybersecurity. During my tenure with the Trusted Networks Lab at QUT, I spearheaded research aimed at pioneering a novel Consensus Protocol tailored for Supply Chain Scenarios, leveraging Email services as a pivotal component. Delving into existing literature, I meticulously reviewed methodologies for securing Email communication channels, encompassing PGP end-to-end encryption for privacy, Digital Signatures for integrity checks, and Distributed Hash Tables for reliability enhancement. Subsequently, I engineered a robust dApp using Web3, seamlessly incorporating Email services atop deployed Solidity Smart Contracts. This innovative solution automated the decentralized voting process, ensuring equitable and dependable decision-making mechanisms for stakeholder scenarios.

<!-- ## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content. -->
