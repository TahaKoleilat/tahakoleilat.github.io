![Illustration of medical segmentation](/images/images.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student at Concordia University working with [IMPACT Lab](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~impact/) and [Health-X Lab](http://www.healthx-lab.ca/) under the supervision of [Hassan Rivaz](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~hrivaz/) and [Yiming Xiao](https://yimingxiao.weebly.com/curriculum-vitae.html).

🔬 My research interests are in multi-modal learning, foundation models, and medical image analysis!

📚 I'm currently working on exciting projects leveraging CLIP and SAM for universal medical image segmentation.

🎉 My paper "MedCLIP-SAM: Bridging Text and Image Towards Universal Medical Image Segmentation" has been accepted at the [27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2024](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/). You can read the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20253) and check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/MedCLIP-SAM).

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Ongoing Research
I am currently engaged in exciting research at the intersection of text and vision, with a specific focus on medical imaging. By seamlessly integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision methodologies, my work aims to revolutionize how textual descriptions and visual data from multiple medical imaging modalities are analyzed and interpreted. This interdisciplinary approach holds tremendous potential to advance diagnostic precision, optimize clinical processes, and ultimately elevate patient care standards within the realm of medical imaging. 

<!-- ## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Relevant Experience
During my tenure at Radical AI, I spearheaded the design and development of innovative educational tools leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI and Google Gemini. One of my key projects involved the creation of ReX, an AI coach that offers personalized career coaching, mentorship, and support to learners throughout their career lifecycle. Additionally, I enhanced Kai, an AI educator, by integrating features that enable it to ingest documents and autonomously generate summaries, multiple-choice questions, and syllabi. These tools are aimed at transforming educational experiences through AI-driven insights and automation.

<!-- ## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content. -->
